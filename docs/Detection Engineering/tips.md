## Tips

* Detections on the entire chain over Detections that covers MITRE
    - Start from the last part of the Kill Chain is more logical, from actions on objectives to Initial Access.
        - Start on the things you don't want to happen, then continue upwards.

- Automate, Every possible thing.
- Threat Intelligence is simply a ton of data.

## Security Detection Lifecycle

1. Determine what you ahve to work with
2. What threat do you want to detect? Reference MITRE ATT&CK
3. Research the threat in your environment and externally
4. Build the logic & test your hypothesis
5. Evaluate next steps (documentation, peer review, etc.)
    * What spurs detection writing?
        * Threat Hunting
        * Security Incident
        * New Asset or Regulation
6. Testing your detection
    * Run your newly written detection in a testing environment
    * Does it detect the behavior you wanted it to?
    * Are there any false positives?
    * What can be improved?
7. Evaluate the Detection
    * If you believe the detection should be in production, document all your reaserch and testing!
8. Then...
    1. Pass it on for peer feedback from your teammates.
    2. Write a playbook with the threat scenario and specific actions that can be taken to investigate this alert.
    3. Evaluate if response can be automated.
